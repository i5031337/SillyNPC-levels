 * face. A pool means a crowd looks like a crowd - but which face somebody gets cannot be
 * decided fresh each time it is asked, because it is asked on every render of every
 * message. A random draw per call would reshuffle every portrait in the chat on each
 * redraw, swipe and reload.
 *
 * So the draw happens once and is remembered. What it is remembered against differs by
 * who is asking:
 *
 *   - somebody with a card and no portrait keeps their face for good, written onto the
 *     card. They are a known person; a face that changes is a different person.
 *   - a stranger keeps theirs for a run of appearances and draws again if they come back
 *     much later. The guard you speak to for three messages is one guard; the guard two
 *     hundred messages later is somebody else wearing the same word.
