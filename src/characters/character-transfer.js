/**
 * Sending one character to somebody else, and taking one in.
 *
 * Separate from the whole-settings export in settings.js, which is a backup: it replaces
 * everything you have with everything in the file. This is the other job - one character
 * out of a collection, into somebody else's collection, alongside what is already there.
 *
 * The difference that shapes the format is that the file has to survive leaving this
 * machine. Two things a character record holds are meaningless anywhere else:
 *
 *   - the lorebook link is { world, uid } - an index into a book the recipient has no
 *     copy of. The entry's own words travel instead.
 *   - portraits are paths into /user/images, naming files the recipient does not have.
 *     They used to be inlined as data URIs and written back to disk on the way in, which
 *     worked and was unusable: a character's list is every picture ever generated for
 *     them, so twenty-eight characters carrying sixty-nine files made a hundred-megabyte
 *     JSON file before base64 added its third. The file is words now, and the picture is
 *     the recipient's to supply.
 *
 * A file written by an older version still carries its portraits, and still gets them
 * back. Nothing in the reader assumes they are absent.
