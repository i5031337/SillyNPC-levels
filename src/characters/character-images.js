/**
 * Where one character's pictures live, and what is in there.
 *
 * Every picture for a character used to land in one flat folder shared by everybody, named
 * after them - `Varga_Elza_1787665547660.png` - which is unmanageable at the forty images
 * a generator produces in an afternoon, and lossy besides: the prefix is sanitised with
 * `\w`, so an accented cast ends up on disk as `Moln_r_Krist_f_` and `Agent_K_roly_`.
 *
 * A folder per character fixes both. `sanitize-filename` keeps spaces and accents, so the
 * folder is `user/images/Varga Elza/` and the filename is free to say what the picture is
 * *for* rather than who it belongs to.
 *
 * **One level, and that is SillyTavern's limit rather than a choice.** Both
 * `/api/images/upload` and `/api/images/list` put the folder through `sanitize-filename`,
 * which deletes slashes - `sillynpc/Elza` arrives as `sillynpcElza` - so a character folder
 * cannot sit inside the configured image folder and cannot hold a subfolder of its own.
 * Only `/api/sprites/get` splits on `/` before sanitising, and that one is rooted in the
 * character-card directory rather than here.
 *
 * Imports settings and nothing else, so it runs in the Node harness.

 * differs by a single character produces a listing of an empty folder rather than an
 * error. So it is copied from that package rather than reasoned out - the first attempt
 * was reasoned out and disagreed on three cases out of twelve, each of which would have
 * been a character whose pictures silently went missing.
 *
 * A check runs both against the real package and asserts they agree.
