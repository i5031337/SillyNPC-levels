/**
 * The wording of every prompt the extension builds in code, as texts you can edit.
 *
 * One text per thing that is sent: a message to a model, or one block put into the story's
 * prompt. What reaches the model as one piece is one text here, so reading a text is reading
 * what is sent, in order.
 *
 * Inside a text:
 *  - {{name}} is filled with your data - the state, the message, a list of fields.
 *  - A section between a line {{#name}} and a line {{/name}} is sent only when {{name}} has
 *    something in it. That is how the LIMITS section disappears when nothing has a limit.
 *  - A line whose placeholders all come out empty is left out.
 *  - Any other double-brace word is left alone, so SillyTavern's own macros survive.
 *
 * Each default is exactly what the code used to send. Kept free of imports beyond settings,
 * so any prompt builder can use it without a cycle.
