 * could do: no record of the past was ever kept.
 *

 * the same rows the review gate already computes - and reconstructs the past by walking
 * backwards from the present, undoing one message at a time. A delta is a few hundred
 * bytes where a state clone is tens of kilobytes.
 *
 * It lives on message.extra, which SillyTavern does not put in the prompt: only
 * extra.reasoning and extra.bias are ever read back. So this is a save, not context - it
 * costs nothing per message and the model never sees it.
