                       Static is the load-bearing half and means something exact: the value
                       is kept once in the item library and copied onto every copy of that
                       item, and getMergedItem writes it back over whatever the reader
                       returns. So sending it repeats the same sentence on everybody carrying
                       a cellphone, to describe something the reader cannot change anyway.

                       Static alone would be too blunt. Under the default rule everything
                       that is not a number is static, so a spell's cost and element would go
                       with it - and the cost is what the reader deducts when a message says
                       somebody cast something without naming a figure. That trades
                       correctness for a few hundred characters.

                       Multi narrows it, and it is worth being straight about what that flag
                       actually declares: it means "edit this in a box I can write several
                       lines in", which is a statement about the editor, not about meaning.
                       It is used here as a proxy for "long enough to be worth not repeating",
                       and it is a good one because nobody asks for a textarea to hold a
