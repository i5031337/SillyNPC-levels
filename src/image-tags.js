/**
 * Which of a character's pictures means which field value.
 *
 * A card can hold a dozen portraits and `imageUrl` names the one in use. This says what
 * the others are *for*: "this one is Elza wounded", "this one is Elza calm". A tag is a
 * fact about the card, so it lives on the card - beside the picture it describes, carried
 * by every copy of the settings, and removed when the picture is.
 *
 * Nothing in SillyNPC acts on a tag. Deciding *which* field wins when two of them name a
 * picture is policy, and policy belongs to whatever is asking - see registerImageTagFields.
 * This module stores explicit tags and reads values encoded in filenames.
 *
 * Imports settings and nothing else, so the whole of it runs in the Node harness.

 * rather than a check for a particular extension: this file is told "these fields want
 * tagging", never "such-and-such is installed", so no addon's name appears here and the
 * next one to want the same thing needs no edit. A check in the test suite asserts that
 * nothing in SillyNPC names an addon, because a comment is the first step towards code.
 *
 * A function rather than a list, because the fields are a setting on the other side and
 * asking each time is the difference between a live answer and a copy taken at load.
