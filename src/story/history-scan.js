/**
 * Bringing collections up to date from the story so far.
 *
 * The per-message extractor only ever sees one message, so an item picked up fifty
 * messages ago and never mentioned since is invisible to it. This reads the history in
 * one pass and proposes what each character should be holding.
 *
 * The difficulty is not finding items - it is *not* finding the ones that are gone. A
 * naive pass returns everything ever mentioned, which quietly resurrects every sword
 * sold and every potion drunk. Three separate guards keep that from happening:
 *
 *  - the prompt asks for the state at the END of the history, and says outright that
 *    anything acquired and later lost must not be listed;
 *  - the dismissal list is sent along, and named as items that must never be proposed;
 *  - every row still goes through the review panel, so nothing lands unseen.
 *
 * The request goes through the tracker's own connection profile, so the story model is
 * not involved and its context is untouched.
