/**
 * Labels that must never be mistaken for a speaker.
 *
 * The speaker test is "bold or italic, followed by a colon", which is exactly how a
 * tabletop narrator writes a roll: "**Cost**: 3 Energy", "**DC**: 15". Those became
 * characters with default avatars, and since a detected speaker is reported as present,
 * they joined the tracker's cast as well.
 *
 * Two sources, because they cover different halves of the problem. Anything you named in
 * System Builder is a property of a character rather than a character, so every configured
 * stat and collection is excluded automatically - that is what stops a stat literally
 * called "Defense Difficulty:" being read as somebody speaking. The rest are terms the
 * narrator uses that the extension has no way to know about, so they are yours to list.
 *
 * Only unknown labels are tested. A name with a card is always a speaker, so a character
 * genuinely called "Guide" is unaffected by "guide" appearing here.
 *
 * @returns {Set<string>} Normalised labels.
