 * Who a piece of text names.

 * Lived in chat.js, where only the chat could reach it. Fill needs the same question
 * answered - is this character actually in the story, or am I about to describe somebody
 * from a page about somebody else - and character-fill.js cannot import chat.js: chat.js
 * reaches it through status-ui, the cast panel, ui-shared, the HUD, the player sheet and
 * ui-manage, and a cycle that only bites when a module is evaluated in the wrong order is
 * the worst kind to leave lying around.
 *
 * The same reasoning that moved the speaker labels and the reprocess handle out. Nothing
 * here touches the DOM or the chat, so it can be imported from anywhere.

/**

 *
 * The boundaries are the whole point, and they are letter-and-digit rather than \b: \b
 * treats an accented letter as a boundary, so "Kristof" would match inside "Kristofnak"
 * and every Hungarian name would match its own inflections. Extracted so the two other
 * callers cannot drift from it - the thread toucher asks this of a thread's `who`, and the
 * extractor asks it of the latest message.
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {string} name
 * @param {boolean} [caseInsensitive] Defaults to true, which is right for anything a model
 *   wrote. Only the chat decorator has a reason to say otherwise.

 * reader needs to know Joe already has a card before it decides he is a new character with
 * nothing to his name.
 *
 * Longest name first, so "The Fae Queen" is not matched as "The Fae". Word boundaries on
 * both sides, so "Ann" does not match inside "Announcement".
