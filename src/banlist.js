/**
 * Phrases the model leans on, stopped rather than asked about.
 *
 * SillyTavern already has a real mechanism for this and it is not a prompt: a text
 * completion backend is sent `banned_strings`, and the sampler cannot emit them. The other
 * extension that ships a "ban list" does not use it - it writes the phrases into the prompt
 * as an instruction, every turn, at that cost, and a model that was going to lean on a
 * phrase is exactly the model that ignores being asked not to.
 *
 * HOW THE REAL BAN IS REACHED, because it is not obvious:
 *
 *   `{{banned "phrase"}}` is a SillyTavern macro. Expanding it pushes the phrase onto
 *   `textgenerationwebui_banned_in_macros` and renders to an empty string.
 *   `getExtensionPrompt` runs `substituteParams` over what it returns, so a macro carried
 *   in an extension prompt is expanded like any other - and getCustomTokenBans reads that
 *   array when it builds the request, then clears it.
 *
 * So the carrier is invisible, costs nothing, never touches the user's own banned-tokens
 * setting, and cannot accumulate. It goes at IN_PROMPT rather than IN_CHAT because that is
 * the position whose text is definitely substituted; where it sits does not matter when
 * the text is empty by the time anyone sees it.
