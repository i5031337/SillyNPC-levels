 * Things said and done that are not finished with.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A MEMORY FEATURE, because it looks like one and is not.
 *
 * Summarising is lossy at the moment of summarising: it keeps what looked important then,
 * so a line that matters four hundred messages later was already dropped. Vector search
 * needs the query to resemble the answer, which is why a search finds a scene about a
 * river and misses the promise made beside one. Neither is a tuning problem; both are
 * what those tools are.
 *
 * The way past it is not to search a haystack better. It is not to make a haystack. You
 * cannot ask a model "will this matter later" - that is the question nobody can answer at
 * the time - but you can ask "did anything here create a promise, a threat, a debt, a
 * secret told, a deadline, a plan". Those are speech acts. They are recognisable as they
 * happen, they are few, and they are what comes back.
 *
 * So a thread is caught when it opens, kept verbatim, injected while it is open, and
 * closed when it resolves. Nothing is retrieved, because nothing was ever filed away.
 */

 * The kinds of thing worth catching. Named so the reader is asked about acts, not
 * importance.
 *
 * `weight` is how well the kind survives being left alone, and the differences are about
 * how each one ends. A debt and a promise stay true until they are discharged, and nothing
 * in the story quietly cancels them. A secret stays true until it is told. A deadline is
 * answerable and then expires. A threat is often rhetoric that the scene moves past. A plan
 * is the one most often silently superseded - people say what they intend to do and then do
 * something else, and nobody narrates the change of mind.
