/**
 * A message, split into the pieces it is actually made of.
 *
 * A reply is rarely one thing. It is a line from one character, then a paragraph of
 * narration, then a line from somebody else - and everything downstream wants to know
 * where those seams are. The chat styling wants them so each speaker's paragraph can carry
 * their colour and their portrait. A visual novel wants them so a reply can be clicked
 * through one voice at a time. Reading a message aloud wants them so each character is read
 * in their own voice.
 *
 * This used to exist only inside decorateSpeechBlocks, as a side effect of styling: it
 * walked the injected avatars and climbed each to its paragraph. Everything the seams are
 * good for other than colour was therefore unreachable, and the obvious way to reach it -
 * a second walk somewhere else - is how two answers to one question start disagreeing.
 * That has happened here twice already, with meters and with deleted stats.
 *
 * So the walk lives here and has one caller in the styling and one in the addon.
 *
 * It reads the *rendered* message, after injectCharacterImages has placed the avatars,
 * because that is where the answer already is: createAvatarImg resolves the card, the
 * persona, the alias and the fallback portrait, and records all of it on the element. A
 * parser working from the raw text would have to redo every one of those decisions.

 * that shows something - a styled box a preset had the model draw, a table, a picture, a
 * panel a regex script built, in whatever shape - is a piece of its own, shown as it is. This
 * used to be a list of shapes (a <div> with no class, a <pre>...), and every user's prompts
 * and regex scripts draw different ones; a list is always one shape short, and what it
 * misses is the thing in the reply that was meant to be looked at.
 *
 * What is skipped, and why it is safe to:
 * - hidden elements, which nobody sees in the chat either;
 * - this extension's own additions - the tracker box, the review panel, raw status blocks;
 * - other extensions' panels: an element carrying a class that the message could not have
 *   written. SillyTavern prefixes every class a message writes with "custom-" (keeping
 *   "fa-", "note-" and "monospace"), so any other class was added by code, not by the story.
 *   Only when it holds no paragraph - a wrapper an extension puts round the text is walked
 *   into, so wrapping a message never hides it.
 *
 * An element holding paragraphs *and* words of its own outside them is kept whole, so the
 * loose words are not lost by reading only its paragraphs.
