 * copies of the same wording, so a help text corrected in one place is corrected in the
 * other - which is the failure a "just copy it over" mirror would have introduced on the
 * first edit.
 *
 * `available` decides whether an entry applies to the current setup at all: the negative
 * prompt is Stable Diffusion's, the reference instruction is Gemini's, and the system
 * rules only reach a model in inline mode. An entry that cannot be sent is not shown as
 * one that can.
