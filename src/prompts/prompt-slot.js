/**
 * Where a writing prompt lives: in SillyTavern's own prompt list, or in the extension's
 * injection slot.
 *
 * The first version of this module got the mechanism wrong, and the mistake is worth
 * recording because the code that misled it is still there. openai.js does pick up
 * extension prompts registered at IN_PROMPT, in preparePromptsForChatCompletion:
 *
 *     if (![BEFORE_PROMPT, IN_PROMPT].includes(prompt.position)) continue;
 *     systemPrompts.push({ identifier: ..., extension: true });
 *
 * but systemPrompts is a local array, used for that one generation and dropped. The list
 * under AI Response Configuration is rendered from somewhere else entirely - prompt_order
 * and serviceSettings.prompts, in PromptManager.renderPromptManagerListItems - and nothing
 * in SillyTavern ever writes an extension prompt into those. So no extension prompt has
 * ever appeared in that list, and no choice of position can make one appear.
 *
 * What that code does give an extension is an override: if an entry with a matching
 * identifier is already in the list, its position, depth, order and role are copied onto
 * the extension prompt. It reads placement from the list; it never adds to it.
 *
 * Being listed therefore means being a real prompt. This module writes one - into the
 * prompt manager's settings and its order - and stops injecting that block through
 * setExtensionPrompt, because doing both sends it twice: an extension prompt set to In-Chat
 * matches the absolute-injection filter and the extension loop in populateChatCompletion,
 * and is inserted by each.
 *
 * The entry is created In-Chat at depth 0, which is exactly where the extension slot puts
 * it, so switching this on moves nothing until the user drags it. From then on the list
 * owns placement and the on/off toggle; the extension still owns the text, and rewrites the
 * entry's content on every send.
 *
 * The cost, which the setting's help text states: the entry lives in the user's chat
 * completion preset. It is saved with it, exported with it, and replaced when another one
 * is loaded - so whatever calls this has to call it again on OAI_PRESET_CHANGED_AFTER.
