 * How the narrator should behave, put where the model will still be reading it.
 *
 * A rule written into a character card or a persona sits at the top of the prompt, and by
 * the time a long chat has been appended underneath it there are thousands of tokens
 * between the instruction and the moment it applies. Rewriting the wording does not fix
 * that; the wording was never the problem. This is the same slot the dialogue format uses
 * for the same reason - depth 0 puts it after the newest message, the last thing read
 * before answering.
 *
 * Nothing is shipped in the box. What the narrator should do is yours to say; the
 * placement is the part this owns. The recommended text in the prompt editor is a
 * starting shape, not a default that gets sent when the box is empty - an empty box here
 * means send nothing, unlike the dialogue format, where empty means the built-in. The
 * difference is that a layout the extension depends on has a right answer and a narrator
 * does not.
