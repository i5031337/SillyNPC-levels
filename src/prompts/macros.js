/**
 * Macros in the prompts you can edit.
 *
 * Two things were true and neither was obvious. SillyTavern's macros - {{user}}, {{char}},
 * {{persona}}, {{time}}, {{roll:d20}}, {{getvar::x}} and the rest - worked in the dialogue
 * format and the narrator rules, because those go out through SillyTavern's own injection
 * and it runs substituteParams over anything it sends. They worked nowhere else, because
 * every other prompt here is sent straight to a model by the extension and SillyTavern
 * never sees it. And the extension's own placeholders - [NAME], [LORE], [CONTEXT] and
 * friends - were plain String.replace calls in two functions, so they worked in exactly
 * the two boxes those functions read.
 *
 * One mechanism now. Every editable prompt goes through applyMacros before it is sent, so
 * SillyTavern's macros work everywhere, and the extension's own values are handed over as
 * dynamic macros in the same {{...}} spelling. [NAME] still works: the old spelling is
 * rewritten to the new one first, which is also what keeps the substitution to one pass.
 *
 * What a prompt can offer depends on what it knows. A profile hint has one subject and can
 * offer {{name}}; the extraction instructions describe a whole scene and cannot. A macro
 * with no value in a given box is left standing rather than blanked - that is
 * SillyTavern's own behaviour for a name it does not recognise, and it means a template
 * pasted into the wrong box shows you what went missing instead of quietly losing it.

/**
 * Rewrites the extension's old [TAG] spelling into SillyTavern's {{tag}}.
 *
 * Done to the template before anything is substituted, so both spellings are resolved in
 * the same pass. That is not tidiness: a [NAME] inside a value being pasted in - a chat
 * excerpt, a lore entry - must not be treated as a placeholder, and running the two passes
 * separately is precisely how it would be.
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {string[]} names The macro names this prompt offers, lowercase.
