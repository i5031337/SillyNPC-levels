               Primary. They are separate places now - HUD and Tracker - and the HUD no
               longer consults visible.

               So a stat that was Primary with visible off, which appeared nowhere, would
               start appearing on the HUD. Clearing Primary keeps it where it was.

               Once, and only for settings that predate the split. Everything else in this
               pass is idempotent by shape - it turns a string into an object, or fills a
               key that is absent - so running it on every load costs nothing. This one is
               not: Primary with Tracker off is a perfectly ordinary choice afterwards, and
               re-running turned it into a checkbox that would not stay ticked. Ticking HUD
               on a stat whose Tracker was off survived until the next reload, then cleared
               itself, which shipped in 0.5.2.

               The version stamp at the end of this pass is what makes it once: after any
               normalisation the stored version is the current one, so this never matches
               again. A separate "already done" marker was tried alongside it and removed -
               it could not fire in any case the version gate did not already cover, and a
               guard that cannot fail is a guard nothing tests. */
