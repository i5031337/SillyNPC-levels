 * sold and every potion drunk. Three separate guards keep that from happening:
 *
 *  - the prompt asks for the state at the END of the history, and says outright that
 *    anything acquired and later lost must not be listed;
 *  - the dismissal list is sent along, and named as items that must never be proposed;
 *  - every row still goes through the review panel, so nothing lands unseen.
 *
 * The request goes through the tracker's own connection profile, so the story model is
 * not involved and its context is untouched.
