/**
 * How much of the tracker box is on screen right now.

 * Deliberately not a setting. Turning the box off in the menu turns off the whole Status
 * Tracker - the prompt injection, the chat decorations, the scan button - because that is
 * what `statusTracker.enabled` means. This answers the smaller question of what to draw,
 * it is expected to be flicked back and forth while reading, and it resets on reload, so
 * writing it to settings.json would put a session's worth of churn through a ~1 MB
 * serialize for something nobody wants remembered.
 *
 * No imports on purpose: settings.js, status-ui.js and chat.js all reach for this, and it
 * has nothing to say back to any of them.
